## Mapping Rules

- Each keyword maps to exactly ONE primary target page/section
- Homepage sections (`/`, `/#features`, `/#solutions`, `/#pricing`) receive brand, platform, and commercial intent keywords
- Blog (`/blog`) absorbs educational, best-practice, and conceptual keywords
- API Docs (`/api-docs`) absorbs developer, implementation, and technical keywords
