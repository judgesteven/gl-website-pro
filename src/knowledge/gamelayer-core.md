# GameLayer Core

GameLayer is a developer-first gamification API platform.

It provides composable mechanics—such as missions, progression, rewards, streaks, and leaderboards—that can be integrated directly into an existing product or service. GameLayer is designed for teams that want to add engagement, retention, or loyalty systems without hard-coding game logic into their core application.

GameLayer is API-first. It does not impose a predefined user interface, user journey, or loyalty program structure. Teams remain in full control of their product experience, while GameLayer handles the underlying mechanics, rules, and state.

GameLayer is typically used by:
- Product and growth teams designing engagement systems
- Engineering teams who want reusable mechanics instead of one-off features
- Businesses where retention, repeat usage, or loyalty are strategic goals

GameLayer focuses on mechanics, not content. It provides the building blocks and rules needed to model engagement systems, while the product team decides how those mechanics are presented to users.

All concrete GameLayer capabilities are defined by the API surface described in the OpenAPI documentation. If a capability is not represented in the API, it should not be assumed to exist.
