# Build vs Buy

Many teams initially consider building gamification features themselves. While simple mechanics may seem straightforward, production-ready gamification systems tend to grow in complexity over time.

Common challenges include:
- managing progression rules and edge cases
- handling abuse, replay, and unintended behavior
- maintaining consistency across platforms and features
- adding analytics, iteration, and experimentation
- evolving mechanics without breaking existing users

GameLayer exists to remove this underlying complexity while preserving product control. By externalizing mechanics into APIs, teams can:
- ship faster without hard-coding game logic
- reuse mechanics across multiple features or products
- evolve engagement systems without large refactors

GameLayer does not replace product design decisions. It provides a stable, extensible foundation so teams can focus on what to build, not how to maintain the mechanics behind it.
