# Why GameLayer

GameLayer differs from traditional gamification and loyalty platforms by focusing on composability and integration rather than fixed programs or UI-driven tools.

Instead of providing a rigid loyalty system, GameLayer exposes mechanics as APIs. This allows teams to:
- Integrate gamification into existing products and workflows
- Design mechanics that fit their product instead of adapting to a platform
- Iterate and experiment without rebuilding core logic

Unlike generic gamification platforms, GameLayer does not require teams to adopt a new frontend, admin UI, or predefined user journey. Mechanics can be triggered by real product events and surfaced in ways that make sense for each product.

Compared to building everything in-house, GameLayer reduces long-term complexity by centralizing:
- rules and progression logic
- reward eligibility and state
- mechanic reuse across features and platforms

GameLayer is designed to be infrastructure, not a campaign tool. It supports long-lived engagement systems that evolve with the product over time.

Concrete capabilities and limitations are defined by the API documentation, not marketing descriptions.
