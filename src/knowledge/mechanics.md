# GameLayer Mechanics

GameLayer provides a set of composable mechanics that can be combined into engagement systems.

## Missions
Missions represent structured objectives users can complete. They are commonly used to guide onboarding, encourage specific behaviors, or create time-bound challenges.

## Progression
Progression models user advancement over time. This can include levels, tiers, or stages and is often used to reinforce long-term engagement.

## Rewards
Rewards are outcomes granted when conditions are met. They can represent virtual items, benefits, or triggers for external systems.

## Streaks
Streaks track repeated behavior over time. They are typically used to encourage consistency and habit formation.

## Leaderboards
Leaderboards introduce comparative feedback. They are most effective when scoped appropriately (time-based, group-based, or role-based).

## Feedback loops
Feedback loops connect actions, progress, and rewards. Well-designed loops reinforce desired behavior without overwhelming the user.

Which mechanics are available, how they are configured, and how they interact is defined by the GameLayer API. Mechanics should be chosen based on product goals, user behavior, and scale.
